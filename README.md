# Runway-Detection-and-Localization-in-Aerial-Images-Using-Deep-Learning
 To build a vision-based system using deep learning and image processing techniques to detect runway and localize the runway.
 Vision based systems provides low-cost solution to detect landing sites by providing rich textual information.
 So we are trying to implement a low cost runway localization system which only use camera as extra hardware to detect runway.
